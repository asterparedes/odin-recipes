    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, minced</li>
        <li>35 ounces Filipino Style Spaghetti Sauce</li>
        <li>1 pound hotdogs, sliced diagonally</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, 
            stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has 
            cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion 
            has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in hot dog slices and continue to cook until hot dogs are heated through.</li>
        <li>Stir in the beef and pork; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until the meat has browned.</li>
        <li>Pour in the spaghetti sauce and water. Simmer until the sauce has thickened, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve over spaghetti with Cheddar cheese sprinkled on top.</li>
    </ol>
